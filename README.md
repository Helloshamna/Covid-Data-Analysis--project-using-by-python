# Covid-Data-Analysis--project-using-by-python
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python to gain insights into the spread, trends, and impact of the virus. The dataset includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and time periods.



## Features:
## Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting the dataset.

. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in cases, deaths, and recoveries using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

  . Time Series Analysis: Using Pandas to track COVID-19 cases over time.

 .  Geographical Impact: Mapping COVID-19 spread using Folium or Plotly.

.  Predictive Modeling (Optional): Applying machine learning techniques like Linear Regression or ARIMA for forecasting future cases.

This project helps understand the dynamics of COVID-19 through data-driven insights and visualizations.
